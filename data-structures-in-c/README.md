# Book: Data structures in C: a pratical approach, by Silvio do Lago Pereira.

> _Original title: Estruturas de Dados em C: uma abordagem prÃ¡tica, por Silvio do Lago Pereira_

> Unfortunatelly, this amazing book is not available in English, but only in Portuguese.

Here I have stored all examples created when reading the book for learning purposes. The book explains about:
* Stacks
* Expressions
* Queues
* Coloring
* Recursion
* Enumeration
* Searching & Ordering
* Linked Lists
* Ordered Lists
* Mapping
* Dictionaries
* Trees
* Huffman Trees
* Graphs

Codes here are not totally equal to the ones available in the book. I like to make my own changes in order to commit my own mistakes and learn with them.
