# Book: Building applications with NodeJS, by William Bruno Moraes.

Here I have stored all examples created when reading the book for learning purposes. The book explains about:
* JavaScript basic concepts
* NodeJS basic concepts, including NPM, Node Debug, Grunt and Gulp
* REST basic concepts, cURL and Postman usage
* Databases: relational (MySQL) and non-relational (MongoDB)
* Template engines
* Automated tests: unit tests and functional tests
* Services and tools for deployment

Codes here are not totally equal to the present in the book. Usually, I like to make things in a different way, so I can across with errors and break my mind trying to solve them, getting more experience and understanding better how things work.
