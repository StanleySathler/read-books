# read-books

## Does it have anything useful?
This repository does not contain anything useful. It is a compilation of all books I've read so far.

## What is this for?
The reason I have a repository for them is because I really believe we should learn by practicing. While reading a book, I like to write things, testing a few theories and question myself. In this process, I need to write a few codes and I really like to have them stored in a place. It helps me look behind and remember who I was X years ago and how much I've improved myself since then.
