# read-books

## What will I find in this repository?
Some interesting things - or maybe not. Actually, it only contains a collection of samples, tests and solved exercises from different books I have read so far. I believe that, by practice, you can get very far.

## What is this for?
The reason I have a repository for the read books is because I really believe we should learn by practicing. While reading a book, I like to write things, testing a few theories and question myself. In this process, I need to write a few codes and I really like to have them stored in a place. It helps me look behind and remember who I was a few years ago and how much I've improved myself since then.
